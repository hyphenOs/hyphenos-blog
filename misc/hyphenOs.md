## Introduction

hyphenOs is a software development and consulting company with expertise in **systems software** and a strong **engineering focus**. We help our clients build software solutions as well as help solve problems at all levels of abstractions of computer systems. We aspire to be 'swiss army knife' for technology needs of our clients.

Our founding team has a hands on experience at all levels of technology stack, from low level diagnostic utilities for custom hardware boards, to software switches to web applications.

We have a very strong emphasis on what we call strong engineering practices i.e. Sprint Boards, Version Control, Unit Testing and Continuous Integration. We strongly believe that the intangible value these practices add are often under-estimated. In any of our engagements, this aspect is of significant importance to us.

## Services
### Prototype and R&D
Sometimes, a new product or service offering that a company wants to develop is not completely aligned with the existing engineering skills. We help companies in developing a quick prototype to assess the feasibility, both technical and business. Depending upon customer's need and expertise, we help in developing the first version of the product from an early PoC or a prototype.

### Remote Engineering Team
Our founding team was part of a couple of startups, one from Bay Area and another from Greater New York Area, with employee #2 and #3 in their engineering team. Our team knows the peculiar challenges that are not uncommon to such engagements. We have grown these teams to over 10 people starting with just two or three. Also, have played a key role in the evolution of the Company's products.

### Problem Solving and Performance Engineering
Leveraging our experience and background at several layers, we help in solving Foo Bar problems and also help identify performance, scalability issues. Typically these are small assignments, but often have a very significant impact.

### Tech Lead As a Service
Often, usually the founding team of a startup usually has a good product concept/idea, but usually only a vague idea about the right technologies, tools they should use and also preparing a roadmap (doing what, when). For the companies, where we believe we can add value, we help them scope out development strategy. If they already have a team in place, but need inputs to take it to next level, we provide assistance. For us, it is important to make a meaningful and measurable difference. It may also happen that we step aside and suggest someone else we knew, if we think we are not the best team for client's specific needs.

## Background
Some concrete examples of what our past experience have been -

1. Developed a quick PoC for migrating from AWS to on premise cloud using just a few built-in bash utils. (Shell Scripting)
2. Developed a front-end prototype for a CFD Application. (`Python VTK`, `Python Qt`)
3. Developed product roadmap and built a team of 10 engineers for a mobile edge computing startup. (Network Architecture, C/C++ for data-path and Go for application platform).
4. Developed a Plugin for Cloud Sandbox Application. (OpenStack, Python)
4. Helped identify and fix performance issues in code, often providing improvement by a factor. (Profiling and Re-factoring.)
5. Helped fix issues in code coverage and unit testing. (`Makefile`, `gcov`, `lcov`)
